# SWEN Cost Strategy and FinOps Policies

## Overview

This document outlines SWEN's cost optimization strategy and FinOps policies for the AI-powered infrastructure platform. The goal is to achieve maximum cost efficiency while maintaining performance and reliability through intelligent automation.

## Cost Optimization Principles

### 1. Zero-Cost Initial Deployment
- **Free Foundation**: Deploy only VPC, Security Groups, and Subnets (FREE)
- **On-Demand Resources**: Load balancers, instances, and storage created only when needed
- **API-Based Cost Analysis**: Use cloud pricing APIs instead of running monitoring infrastructure
- **Conditional Creation**: Resources created only when workloads are approved

### 2. AI-Driven Cost Optimization
- **Automated Decision Making**: AI engine continuously analyzes cost patterns and makes routing decisions
- **Predictive Scaling**: ML models predict workload patterns to optimize resource allocation
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Real-time analysis of spot instances, reserved instances, and on-demand pricing
- **Continuous Monitoring**: AI monitors costs every hour and requests approval to switch providers

### 3. Multi-Cloud Cost Arbitrage
- **Cost Comparison**: Continuous monitoring of AWS vs Alibaba Cloud pricing via APIs
- **Regional Optimization**: Route workloads to lowest-cost regions while maintaining latency requirements
- **Credit Utilization**: Maximize use of cloud credits and discounts
- **Provider Switching**: AI automatically switches providers when cheaper options are available

### 4. Resource Efficiency
- **Right-Sizing**: AI-driven instance type selection based on actual workload requirements
- **Spot Instance Strategy**: Aggressive use of spot instances for non-critical workloads
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on demand patterns and cost thresholds
- **Complete Infrastructure Stack**: AI provisions LB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, CDN based on workload needs

## Budget Management

### Monthly Budget Allocation
```
Total Monthly Budget: $10,000
├── AWS (60%): $6,000
├── Alibaba Cloud (35%): $3,500
└── Monitoring & Tools (5%): $500
```

### Budget Thresholds
- **Warning Level**: 70% of monthly budget ($7,000)
- **Critical Level**: 85% of monthly budget ($8,500)
- **Emergency Level**: 95% of monthly budget ($9,500)

### Cost Categories
1. **Compute Resources** (70%)
   - EC2/ECS instances
   - Auto-scaling groups
   - Spot instances

2. **Storage** (15%)
   - EBS volumes
   - S3 storage
   - Database storage

3. **Network** (10%)
   - Data transfer
   - Load balancers
   - CDN costs

4. **Monitoring & Tools** (5%)

   - Observability stack

## AI Routing Cost Logic

### Cost Factors (Weighted)
1. **Instance Cost** (40%)
   - On-demand vs spot pricing
   - Regional price differences
   - Instance type optimization

2. **Data Transfer Costs** (25%)
   - Cross-region transfer
   - Internet egress
   - Inter-cloud communication

3. **Storage Costs** (20%)
   - EBS vs EFS pricing
   - S3 storage classes
   - Backup and retention

4. **Reserved Capacity** (15%)
   - Reserved instance utilization
   - Savings plans
   - Commitment optimization

### AI Decision Matrix
```
Cost Optimization Score = 
  (Instance Cost × 0.4) + 
  (Data Transfer × 0.25) + 
  (Storage × 0.2) + 
  (Reserved Capacity × 0.15)
```

## Approval Policies

### Automatic Approval
